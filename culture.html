                                <p>After breakfast, Romans would attend to their business affairs in the Forum, visit the markets, or for the wealthy, perhaps attend meetings of the Senate.</p>

                                <p>The baths typically included a sequence of rooms with cold, warm, and hot pools, as well as exercise areas and sometimes libraries.</p>

                                <p>Commoners would typically have a simpler meal at home before retiring as darkness fell, while the elite might continue their socializing well into the night by lamplight.</p>
